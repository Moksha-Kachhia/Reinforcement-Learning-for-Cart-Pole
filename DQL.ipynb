    "The objective of DQL is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward for an agent interacting with an environment. It uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value function, which estimates the expected reward for taking a particular action in a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of DQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q-Value Function: Represents the expected future reward of taking an action in a given state.\n",
    "- Deep Q-Network (DQN): A neural network used to approximate the Q-value function.\n",
    "- Experience Replay: A technique where experiences (state, action, reward, next state) are stored in a replay buffer and sampled randomly for training.\n",
    "- Target Network: A separate network used to stabilize training by providing consistent target values for the Q-network.\n",
